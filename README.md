## 🎓 Learning Source  
This project was built while learning from the **ChaiAurCode** YouTube channel. 🚀
I have improved some existing features and introduced new ones, such as a dedicated section for users to view their own posts. Additionally, the homepage now displays posts, but the documents within them cannot be accessed directly from there.
